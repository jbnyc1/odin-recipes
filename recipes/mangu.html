    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Green plantains — Avoid using plantain if there is any sight of it turning yellow, making it
            close to ripening. Green plantains is the best type of plantain to look for this specific recipe as mangú is not meant to be sweet </li>
        <li>Salt — for flavor!</li>
        <li>Water — This is to help mash the plantains. Although the boiled plantains will already contain some water, this is good to have on hand if it’s still missing some moisture.
            Some may also use milk, which is another option if you would prefer </li>
        <li>Butter — This is used mainly to help soften the plantains while mashing, but is also good for flavoring as opposed to regular cooking oil</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2> 
      <ol>
        <li>Peel the plantains and cut lengthwise, then divide each half into two. Check out my post on How to Peel Plantains quickly and easily.</li>
        <li>Add the plantains to a pot and boil over a medium high heat in enough water to cover them and salt until they are very tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the plantains from the water and mash them right away with a fork until they are very smooth and there are few to no lumps. Mix in 
            butter, and water. Keep mashing and mixing until smooth.</li>
      </ol>
