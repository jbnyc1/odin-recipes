    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat — traditional Dominican sancocho uses a combination of pork, beef, and/or chicken</li>
        <li>Seasonings — We add oregano, adobo, whole allspice, salt, and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Sofrito — For sazón!</li>
        <li>Chicken Bouillon — As most Dominican soups and stews call for.</li>
        <li>Lime — For a bit of acidity to balance flavors</li>
        <li>Vegetables — Plantains, corn, carrots, yuca, yautia, and Kabocha squash (auyama)</li>
        <li>Herbs — Cilantro, recao culantro (cilantro ancho), and thyme</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2> 
      <ol>
        <li>Mash oregano, garlic, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Mix beef, pork, chicken, and lemon juice together in a large bowl; drain 1/2 of 
            the liquid. Mix in onions, mashed garlic mixture, 2 tablespoons oil, and vinegar.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meat mixture
             in three batches and cook until browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes per batch.</li>
        <li>Transfer browned meats to an 8-quart Dutch oven. Pour in 1/2 of the water, then add chicken
             broth, beef consommé, 2 bouillon cubes, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then
            reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until meats are more than halfway cooked through, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add pumpkin, sweet potatoes, eddeos, yuca, potatoes, plantains, corn, celery, carrots, bell pepper, cilantro, remaining
            bouillon cubes, and adobo seasoning to the Dutch oven. Increase the heat to medium and return to a boil. Reduce the heat
            to low and simmer, stirring in remaining water as needed in gradual increments to replace evaporated liquid, until root
            vegetables are soft and liquid has thickened, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>During the last 30 minutes of cooking, transfer beef, pork, and chicken to a cutting board. Let cool slightly, then remove
            bones and chop or shred meat. Return meat to the stew and finish cooking.</li>
      </ol>
